# LearningChallenges
Small mini-app learning challenges to help me get more acclimated with C++

Since my school has only used Java for my CS classes, I wanted to get used to the C++ language.

This is just a collection of small challenges that I am solving using as much of C++ as I can.
These can certainly be solved quite easily procedurally with a big main() function but I wanted to really
get used to classes and memory allocation, as well as experience the differences between this and other languages.
